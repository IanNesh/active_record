# Project Title
Active Record Code Challenge: Product Review

## Project Description
For this assignment, we'll be working with an e-commerce domain. We'll be focusing on the product reviews.

This repo contains Many to Many class relationship which is also called the Has-Many-Through relationship, which exists between two objects and occurs when a single instance of an entity, relates to many instance of another entity and vise versa. As an example we have three models: User, Review, and Product.For our purposes, a Product has many Users, a User has many Products’ s, and a Review belongs to a User and to a Product.

Product - User is a many-to-many relationship.
